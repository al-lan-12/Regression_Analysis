# Regression_Analysis

It contains all the basic Regression analysis algorithm implementations

  Linear Regression : The code visualizes the custom data and makes the most suitable linear line for the data and predicts the output according to it 
  
  Multiple Regression : The code take the Cars.csv Data sets and find the relationship between volume and weight of the car with respect to CO2 emmision and predicts the CO2 emissions according to it 
  
  Polynomial Regresson : The code takes in custom data and visualises the datapoints and finds the most suitable lines passing through most data points and according to which it predicts the output
  

Fuel Consumption :
The code here takes in the datasets from the FuelConsumption.csv and implements the linear regression to find the CO2 emissions according to the engine size .The data set is divided into training and testing datasets and gives Mean_Absolute_Error of 23
